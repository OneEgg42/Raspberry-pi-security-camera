# Raspberry-pi-security-camera
A camera connected to the raspberry pi that will take photos at a chosen time and then emails the images to you. The program automatically organises the photos into folders with the date

The only hardware you need is a raspberry pi camera and a pi. Just connect the camera's cable to the correct socket.
If you want to use the code just change the emails and password to your ones and change the dest to the place where you want the photos to be stored
